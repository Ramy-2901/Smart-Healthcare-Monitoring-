\section{SUMMARY}
In this paper,the authors ,Shubham Banka ,Isha Madan and S.S. Saranya have presented and proved the prototype for
an automatic system that guarantees a constant monitoring of
various health parameters and prediction of any kind of
disease or disorder that prevents the patient from the pain of
paying frequent visits or travelling to the hospitals themselves.
 \\The system discussed here consists of
various medical devices such as sensors and web based or
mobile based applications which communicate via network
connected devices and helps to monitor and record patients's
health data and medical information.
This paper demonstrates a Remote Health Monitoring System
controlled by Raspberry pi. \\ In this paper, a system is designed to
continuously monitor the vital parameters such as heart rate,
blood pressure and body temperature. The information is
stored on a cloud server database and can be displayed
through an online website or mobile application by authorized
personnel only. The main objective of this system is to update
the data online and send an alert to the doctors for any
abnormality and also predict if the patient is having any
disease. \\Health Monitoring Section module comprises of the hardware components of the
system that makes it IoT enabled and is used to record the
health parameters of the patient using various sensors. Here,
Raspberry pi acts as a central server to which all the sensors
are connected through the GPIO pins or using MCP3008
analog-to-digital convertor if their output is in the analog form
as raspberry pi works only on digital signals.\\Emergency Alert Section module in particularly deals with the steps to be taken
after an abnormality is detected in the health of patient such as
notifying his/her family member as well as the hospital. \\ARCHITECTURE: \\they propose an automatic system to monitor
patientâ€™s body temperature, heart rate, body movements and
blood pressure. Further they extend the existing system to
predict if the patient is suffering from any chronic disorder or
disease using the various health parameter and various other
symptoms that are obtained by the system. \LARGE 

\section{Main objective or aim of the authors:}
To obtain the real-time medical information about a
patient via IoT,processing and classification of information gathered
about the patient,to interpret and predict any disease or disorder in
preliminary stage itself using the data mining
techniques that will also provide the approach
advantageous for decision making,to provide Internet of Things based healthcare
solutions at anytime and anywhere. \LARGE

\section{MY UNDERSTANDINGS AND VIEWS ON THE PAPER:}
I feel that the system described in this paper is of extreme use to patients and doctors as well. The patient
can check their health status anytime from the comfort of their
homes and visit hospitals only when they really need to.\\I feel that the Health Status Prediction System  is one of the most promising modules of the system.The system shows the almost
real time values of various health parameters and emulates
how the same can be implemented in the real world and the
doctors can also use the log of the patient body condition to
study and determine the effect of medicine or other such
things.The smart prediction module predicts the disease that the
patient is suffering from by asking them for various symptoms
they may have and the options are based on the previous
symptom.  \LARGE

\section{Agreements,Suggestions:}
I agree that the  MCP3008 chip is a great option if one needs to read
simple analog signals, like from a temperature or light sensor.
I agree that the Health Status Prediction System  is one of the most promising modules of the system.The system can be further improved further by adding
artificial intelligence system components to facilitate the
doctors and the patients.
